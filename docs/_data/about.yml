profile:
  role: Computer Scientist, Researcher & Educator
  location: Dresden, Germany

bio:
  - I'm a computer scientist passionate about building thoughtful, well-crafted software at the intersection of web development, machine learning, and data visualization. I enjoy turning complex ideas into clear, usable systems—whether that's an interactive interface, a model that explains itself, or a visualization that makes patterns visible at a glance.
  - Currently, I work as a researcher in artificial intelligence, focusing on the development and evaluation of intelligent systems. My work combines practical engineering with academic curiosity, exploring how machine learning models can be made more reliable, interpretable, and useful in real-world contexts.
  - Previously, I studied computer science alongside teaching and education, which shaped how I approach both research and development. I've worked on a range of projects spanning web applications, experimental ML pipelines, and educational tools, always with a strong emphasis on clarity, accessibility, and knowledge sharing.
  - Outside of work, I'm usually hiking through forests or mountains, building things by hand, experimenting with code and visualizations, or spending time in nature recharging. I'm queer, curious by default, and happiest when learning something new or making something tangible.
