bio:
  - "I'm a computer scientist passionate about building thoughtful, well-crafted software at the intersection of web development, machine learning, and data visualization. I enjoy turning complex ideas into clear, usable systems: whether that's an interactive interface, a model that explains itself, or a visualization that makes patterns visible at a glance."
  - Currently, I research uncertainty quantification in large language models, studying how these models and methods work while benchmarking different approaches. My focus is on understanding, evaluating, and improving the reliability and interpretability of machine learning systems.
  - Previously, I studied computer science alongside teaching and education, which shaped how I approach both research and development. I've worked on a range of projects spanning web applications, ML pipelines, and educational tools, always with a strong emphasis on clarity, accessibility, and knowledge sharing.
  - Outside of work, I’m usually hiking through forests or mountains, building things by hand, experimenting with code and visualizations, or writing poetry. I'm queer, naturally curious, and happiest when learning something new or creating something tangible.

      title: Researcher (Artificial Intelligence)
      company: Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf
      description: "Conducted research on uncertainty quantification in large language models, including an extensive literature review and a systematic comparison of multiple approaches. I evaluated methods across a wide range of models with different architectures, providers, sizes, and variants (base, instruct, and reasoning). I gained hands-on experience with vLLM and developed a framework for large-scale LLM benchmarking with a strong focus on efficiency, modularity, and reproducibility. I presented my work in the form of two posters at two international conferences and submitted a research paper to ICML. In addition, I shared my expertise by preparing and teaching a one-day workshop on large language models, covering their architecture, prompting techniques, and programmatic use for classification tasks in research at the HZDR HPC Fall School 2025."

      description: This poster presents a modular benchmarking framework designed to ensure reproducibility and transparency when evaluating probabilistic and resource-intensive AI systems, with a focus on uncertainty estimation for large language models. The framework decouples model execution from evaluation logic, enabling consistent, reusable, and longitudinal benchmarking as models and APIs evolve.
