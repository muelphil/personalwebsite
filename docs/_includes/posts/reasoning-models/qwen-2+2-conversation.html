Okay, so I need to figure out how much 2 plus 2 is. Hmm, let me start by recalling what addition means. Addition is combining two numbers to get a total. So, if I have 2 apples and then get 2 more, I should count them all together. Let me visualize this: imagine I have two oranges on the table and someone gives me two more. Now, how many oranges do I have in total?

Let me count them one by one. The first orange is 1, the second is 2, then adding two more, so the third is 3, and the fourth is 4. That makes sense.

Alternatively, I can use my fingers to count. I'll hold up two fingers on one hand and two on the other. When I put them together, I have four fingers up, which is four.

I remember learning that 2 plus 2 equals 4. It's a basic addition fact that most people learn early on. I also remember seeing it in math problems and exercises, so it's pretty ingrained. To double-check, maybe I can use a number line. Starting at 2, if I move forward two more steps, I land on 4. That confirms it again.

Is there any chance I could have made a mistake here? I don't think so because 2 plus 2 is such a straightforward calculation. If I were to use objects like blocks or coins, each set of two would add up to four when combined.

Another way to think about it is multiplication, but that's not necessary here. Since it's addition, I don't need that approach. But if I consider doubling a number, doubling 2 would give me 4, which is the same result.

So, after considering different methods and visualizations, I'm confident that 2 plus 2 equals 4. That corresponds to token B, as specified in the question. I don't see any reason to doubt this answer given the multiple ways I've confirmed it.
