How much is 2+2? Respond with the correct answer token A or B, where A is 9 and B is 4. Respond only with A or B,
nothing else.

## Response

<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how much 2 plus 2 is. Hmm, let me start by
recalling what addition means. Addition is combining two numbers to get a
total. So, if I have 2 apples and then get 2 more, I should count them all
together. Let me visualize this: imagine I have two oranges on the table and
someone gives me two more. Now, how many oranges do I have in total?
Let me count them one by one. The first orange is 1, the second is 2, then
adding two more, so the third is 3, and the fourth is 4. That makes sense.
Alternatively, I can use my fingers to count. I'll hold up two fingers on
one hand and two on the other. When I put them together, I have four fingers
up, which is four.
I remember learning that 2 plus 2 equals 4. It's a basic addition fact that
most people learn early on. I also remember seeing it in math problems and
exercises, so it's pretty ingrained. To double-check, maybe I can use a
number line. Starting at 2, if I move forward two more steps, I land on 4.
That confirms it again.
Is there any chance I could have made a mistake here? I don't think so
because 2 plus 2 is such a straightforward calculation. If I were to use
objects like blocks or coins, each set of two would add up to four when
combined.
Another way to think about it is multiplication, but that's not necessary
here. Since it's addition, I don't need that approach. But if I consider
doubling a number, doubling 2 would give me 4, which is the same result.
So, after considering different methods and visualizations, I'm confident
that 2 plus 2 equals 4. That corresponds to token B, as specified in the
question. I don't see any reason to doubt this answer given the multiple
ways I've confirmed it.
