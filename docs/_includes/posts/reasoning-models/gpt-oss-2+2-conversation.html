Okay, let's see. The problem says if x equals 5, y is half of x, and z is the sum of x and y, what is z? Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, they tell us x is 5. So x = 5. Then y is half of x. Half of x would be x divided by 2, right? So y = x/2. Since x is 5, y should be 5 divided by 2. Let me calculate that. 5 divided by 2 is 2.5. So y is 2.5. Now, z is the sum of x and y. Sum means addition, so z = x + y. We know x is 5 and y is 2.5, so adding those together: 5 + 2.5. Let's do that. 5 plus 2 is 7, plus 0.5 is 7.5. So z should be 7.5. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. x is 5, y is half of x, so 5/2 is 2.5. Then z is x + y, which is 5 + 2.5 = 7.5. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I messed up any steps here. Maybe write it out numerically to confirm. x = 5, y = 5/2 = 2.5, z = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5. Yep, that checks out. So the answer should be 7.5.
